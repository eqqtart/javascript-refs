# Agenda

3. prompts.js
4. numbers.js
------------
5. for.js + loops.js
6. while.js
------------
7. fxns.js


## After numbers.js - Code Breaker
Create an code breaker application.
1. The user should be able to guess the 4-digit code.
2. If the guess is more than 4 digits, an error message should be logged to the console.
3. If the guess is less than 3 digits, an error message should be logged to the console.
4. If the user guesses correctly, a congratulations message should be logged to the console.

### Additional Challenges
1. Instead of a four digit code, could you make it a four letter code?
    - Could you make the code case sensitive? Or make the user's guess case insensitive?
2. Could you have the 4 digit code be different each time you refresh the page, so that the user can play over and over?
